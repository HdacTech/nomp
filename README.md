# Hdac Node Mining Portal

**`Hdac Node Mining`** Portal uses open source.

See [Open Source NOMP](https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal)


## 1. OS Setup

ubuntu 16.04. * Based on the latest version.

```
>sudo apt-get update

>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

>sudo apt-get install git

>sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libdb5.1-dev libdb5.1++-dev mysql-server
```

* ubuntu 14.04.* Version

In addition, library should be installed in order.

```
>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test

>sudo apt-get update

>sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
```

## 2. NVM Setup

Install and manage the version of nodejs by using nvm. nvm can not manage nodeJs not installed via nvm.    
Therefore, if nodeJs not installed through the existing nvm are already installed, delete and reinstall them.    


### NVM Install

```
>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash

>nvm install 8.9.4

>nvm use 8.9.4
```

## 3. Redis Setup

Download And Unzip

```
>wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz

>tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz

```

Move To redis-stable folder

```
>cd redis-stable

>make

>sudo make install


>redis-server
```

# NOMP Install

```
>git clone https://github.com/Hdactech/nomp.git nomp
>cd nomp
>npm update
```

##### 2. Coin Configuration

###### config.json

There are a number of coin configuration files in the coin folder. The coin setting information of the **`HDAC`** is as follows.

```javascript
{
    "name": "HDAC",
    "symbol": "DAC",
    "algorithm": "lyra2rev2",
    /**
     * @Hdac
     * Add the 'reward' key value for ePoW, a unique consensus algorithm of Hdac.
     * This annotation should be removed when reflecting on the server due to the JSON formatting convention.
     */
    "reward": "ePoW"
}
```
Check [here](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage) for how to set the algorithm setting information of the other coins.


##### 3. Pool Configuration

###### h-dac.json

       except for a percentage that can go to, for examples, pool operator(s) as pool fees or
